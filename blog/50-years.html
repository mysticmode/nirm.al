        Today 20th, July 2023 marks 50 years since Bruce Lee's passing on
        1973. My father had told me about Bruce Lee, his speed, his efficacy
        and his life when I was a kid.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only at the very recent I started digging through his style and his
        teachings by reading about him and watching his videos.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there is one thing I learned from this spectacular teacher, that
        should be - There is no limit in what you do, in what you pursue.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a blog post I wrote about him last year -
