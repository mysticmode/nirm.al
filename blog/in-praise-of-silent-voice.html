      <h3>In praise of silent voice <span class="date">[2022-10-20]</span></h3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Our societal norms is not only filled with people pertaining to the
          attributes of materialistic life, it also contains this false
          appreciation of superiority to the ones who makes the noise more than
          others.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would characterize this as materialist voice. A materialist voice
          fame oneself onto the glory of power by falsehood perception that
          everything belongs and pertain to the ones who put forth the voice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whereas, the silent voice doesn’t crave this mania, since it doesn’t
          wave about the perspective or motive towards the falsehood of oneself
          or the others. The silent voice belongs to the self which doesn’t know
          to part ways towards one or the other. There is no separation in
          itself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The perseverance of silence is silence. The words of no words is
          silence. Silence touches beyond the realm of words. It determines the
          aspective towards clarity in life. Silence cannot be suppressed, it
          can only be witnessed.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the world we live in where the masters of the materialist voice
          perceives that there is no accordance to the nature of oneself is
          within oneself. They think the actions that they take regards to the
          wellness of others or for themselves are based on external happenings.
          The silent voice exemplifies that the worrisome of these external
          happenings is the source of not being one in harmony within oneself.
        </p>
        <p>
          The proximity of silence can get others’ awareness directing to their
          cause and transform themselves onto the path of seeking for oneness
          and harmony.
        </p>
        <p>
          Henceforth, in praise of silence, I try to say that in the connotation
          within the realm of words -- it prevails.
        </p>
