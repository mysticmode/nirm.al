      <p>
        Our societal norms is not only filled with people pertaining to the
        attributes of materialistic life, it also contains this false
        appreciation of superiority to the ones who makes the noise more than
        others.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would characterize this as materialist voice. A materialist voice
        fame oneself onto the glory of power by falsehood perception that
        everything belongs and pertain to the ones who put forth the voice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas, the silent voice doesn’t crave this mania, since it doesn’t
        wave about the perspective or motive towards the falsehood of oneself
        or the others. The silent voice belongs to the self which doesn’t know
        to part ways towards one or the other. There is no separation in
        itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The perseverance of silence is silence. The words of no words is
        silence. Silence touches beyond the realm of words. It determines the
        aspective towards clarity in life. Silence cannot be suppressed, it
        can only be witnessed.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the world we live in where the masters of the materialist voice
        perceives that there is no accordance to the nature of oneself is
        within oneself. They think the actions that they take regards to the
        wellness of others or for themselves are based on external happenings.
        The silent voice exemplifies that the worrisome of these external
        happenings is the source of not being one in harmony within oneself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proximity of silence can get others’ awareness directing to their
        cause and transform themselves onto the path of seeking for oneness
        and harmony.
      </p>
      <p>
        Henceforth, in praise of silence, I try to say that in the connotation
        within the realm of words -- it prevails.
