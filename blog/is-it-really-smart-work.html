      <p>
        Just went to a tea shop, the FM Radio played about doing smart work
        instead of hard work.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I heard this statement multiple times. I think that is not a valid
        statement to me unless I'm missing something.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every smartness that comes in you is the hours and days you put your
        effort in to mastery
      </p>
      <p>IOW, smart work is the asset of hard work.</p>
      <p>
        To put in another way, It is through the hardship, the time gives you
        the gift of experience which is the foundation for smart work.
