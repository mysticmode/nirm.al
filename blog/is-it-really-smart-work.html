      <h3>Is it really smart work? <span class="date">[2022-05-02]</span></h3>

      <div class="content">
        <p>
          Just went to a tea shop, the FM Radio played about doing smart work
          instead of hard work.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I heard this statement multiple times. I think that is not a valid
          statement to me unless I'm missing something.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every smartness that comes in you is the hours and days you put your
          effort in to mastery
        </p>
        <p>IOW, smart work is the asset of hard work.</p>
        <p>
          To put in another way, It is through the hardship, the time gives you
          the gift of experience which is the foundation for smart work.
        </p>
