        Human brains are tentatively complex for many to write articles, do
        research and ideally use it. So, pertinently I’m tentative to think
        that I know of a small bit of it which I’d like to take a small bite.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often, we see and hear of where creatives come up with something new
        to the fruition for which they don’t tend to acclaim that this is done
        by them. This is because of the play of unconscious mind in their
        doings. The mind that collects and stores inadvertently. In other
        words, without knowing that we are observing that.
      </p>
      <p>
        This part of processing thoughts from unconscious level thinking has
        helped many artists bring fruition to their work that leads to
        different interpreted projections from people who perceive that.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this elevated thinking takes courage. We see, like Bob Dylan
        mentioned, that one can process at the unconscious level. But how long
        we can survive in that state until those drains are a matter of
        another topic (possibly researched at the scientific level, that I’m
        not sure of).
      </p>
      <p>
        Society and the system do not pertain to this way of thinking because
        it is structured way of thinking, hence people has to go out of the
        way to see themselves in a creative state where they can access things
        that cannot be done at a conscious level. And this system conceives
        that manner as a freaky state of mind. In short, the person is a
        freak.
      </p>
      <p>
        The awareness and the happenings at the presence at the unconscious
        level is more abrasive, where you notice things that’s happening at
        that moment in a state that doesn’t often show to others that you are
        observing that. But for you, you will do that, and you notice that you
        are doing it in a state of mind where you are totally out of it. There
        is no "Me" in there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The unconscious mind is like the tip of a double-edged sword to you
        and to others’ with you. You play there, you live there as long as you
        are able to keep up with that state of mind. And you better feel
        lucky, if you can come out of it when you desperately want to.
