          Human brains are tentatively complex for many to write articles, do research and ideally use it. So, pertinently I’m tentative to think that I know of a small bit of it which I’d like to take a small bite.

          Often, we see and hear of where creatives come up with something new to the fruition for which they don’t tend to acclaim that this is done by them. This is because of the play of unconscious mind in their doings. The mind that collects and stores inadvertently. In other words, without knowing that we are observing that.
        </p>
        <p>
          This part of processing thoughts from unconscious level thinking has helped many artists bring fruition to their work that leads to different interpreted projections from people who perceive that. 
        </p>

          And this elevated thinking takes courage. We see, like Bob Dylan mentioned, that one can process at the unconscious level. But how long we can survive in that state until those drains are a matter of another topic (possibly researched at the scientific level, that I’m not sure of). 
        </p>
        <p>
          Society and the system do not pertain to this way of thinking because it is structured way of thinking, hence people has to go out of the way to see themselves in a creative state where they can access things that cannot be done at a conscious level. And this system conceives that manner as a freaky state of mind. In short, the person is a freak. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The awareness and the happenings at the presence at the unconscious level is more abrasive, where you notice things that’s happening at that moment in a state that doesn’t often show to others that you are observing that. But for you, you will do that, and you notice that you are doing it in a state of mind where you are totally out of it. There is no "Me" in there. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The unconscious mind is like the tip of a double-edged sword to you and to others’ with you. You play there, you live there as long as you are able to keep up with that state of mind. And you better feel lucky, if you can come out of it when you desperately want to.
