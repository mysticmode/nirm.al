          One of my friends whose name is Hari Krishnan had shared me this video
          today morning. Like me, he was interested in searching for the truth,
          or maybe we could say as a spiritual wellness. I told him that I had
          his final talks edited by David Godman as a book. He had come to
          notice this video interview on YouTube and he shared it with me. No
          doubts, I was delighted and thanked him.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I just watched the whole video. What Annamalai Swami talks in this
          video is very simple. But maybe I could say, my mother tongue being
          Tamil could be a reason for this.
        </p>
        <p>
          What the interviewer and the interpreter could try to ask makes much
          more sense to me, they were trying to see and perceive what made a
          Jnani like Annamalai Swami could delve into the self and how did they
          continue to stay there in that state their whole life.
        </p>
        <p>
          Interviewer seems to be an American trying to perceive that how could
          we live such a life say for example living in New York or Los Angeles.
          Where people constantly looking for the other way which is an
          illusion. By which I mean, the materialistic life in this samsara.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was taught in an English medium school. And I came to be in touch
          with many people from western countries for the last 10 years by being
          in ashrams and traveling around. I particularly or firmly established
          myself in their way of thinking to achieve something which was - I
          need recognition from this world. That said, I don't want to say this
          is the fault of the westerners. This is of myself. Maybe I could say I
          was thinking I'm the mind and I'm the body as Annamalai Swami puts
          constantly in this video.
        </p>
        <p>
          Annamalai Swami asks, when you are in a deep sleep, do you know who
          you are? Then the conversation goes like this, we don’t - So, we are
          not the mind and we are not the body. Who else then? The Self which is
          known as Atman is a revered word in this philosophy. I cannot say it
          clearly because the irony is that – I'm like that interviewer who
          sometimes can feel that but it fades away because of this society that
          we are living in.
        </p>
        <p>
          One more important question regarding the point I’ve mentioned above
          which is fading away, Swami says that constant inquiry is Jnana which
          resonates with me deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
          It seems like reading, watching and understanding is all few
          percentages but the thing is we need to stay there and inquire
          ourselves the question that Swami says.
