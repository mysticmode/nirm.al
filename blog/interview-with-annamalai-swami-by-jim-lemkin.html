        One of my friends whose name is Hari Krishnan had shared me this video
        today morning. Like me, he was interested in searching for the truth,
        or maybe we could say as a spiritual wellness. I told him that I had
        his final talks edited by David Godman as a book. He had come to
        notice this video interview on YouTube and he shared it with me. No
        doubts, I was delighted and thanked him.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I just watched the whole video. What Annamalai Swami talks in this
        video is very simple. But maybe I could say, my mother tongue being
        Tamil could be a reason for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        What the interviewer and the interpreter could try to ask makes much
        more sense to me, they were trying to see and perceive what made a
        Jnani like Annamalai Swami could delve into the self and how did they
        continue to stay there in that state their whole life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interviewer seems to be an American trying to perceive that how could
        we live such a life say for example living in New York or Los Angeles.
        Where people constantly looking for the other way which is an
        illusion. By which I mean, the materialistic life in this samsara.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was taught in an English medium school. And I came to be in touch
        with many people from western countries for the last 10 years by being
        in ashrams and traveling around. I particularly or firmly established
        myself in their way of thinking to achieve something which was - I
        need recognition from this world. That said, I don't want to say this
        is the fault of the westerners. This is of myself. Maybe I could say I
        was thinking I'm the mind and I'm the body as Annamalai Swami puts
        constantly in this video.
      </p>
      <p>
        Annamalai Swami asks, when you are in a deep sleep, do you know who
        you are? Then the conversation goes like this, we don’t - So, we are
        not the mind and we are not the body. Who else then? The Self which is
        known as Atman is a revered word in this philosophy. I cannot say it
        clearly because the irony is that – I'm like that interviewer who
        sometimes can feel that but it fades away because of this society that
        we are living in.
      </p>
      <p>
        One more important question regarding the point I’ve mentioned above
        which is fading away, Swami says that constant inquiry is Jnana which
        resonates with me deeply.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems like reading, watching and understanding is all few
        percentages but the thing is we need to stay there and inquire
        ourselves the question that Swami says.
