        <p>
          While I'm writing this, I have a new found feeling that I'm going to
          share some experience and make a thoughtful impact for the readers.
          And as well, leave something worthwhile behind which might not vanish
          across time. I hope, this thought from me and this resource persists.
        </p>
        <p>
          Here, I'm going to write whatever thoughts, feelings and information
          that I could be able to put it into words. This just doesn't stick
          around that, I mean the spiritual aspects of me. But also, I'll be
          sharing some technical articles and tutorials that I learn. After all,
          my profession is writing softwares.
