      <p>
        While I'm writing this, I have a new found feeling that I'm going to
        share some experience and make a thoughtful impact for the readers.
        And as well, leave something worthwhile behind which might not vanish
        across time. I hope, this thought from me and this resource persists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, I'm going to write whatever thoughts, feelings and information
        that I could be able to put it into words. This just doesn't stick
        around that, I mean the spiritual aspects of me. But also, I'll be
        sharing some technical articles and tutorials that I learn. After all,
        my profession is writing softwares.
