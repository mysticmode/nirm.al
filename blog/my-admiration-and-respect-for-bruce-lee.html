        Many generations come and go and as an individual you most likely have
        few people in the past to admire and learn from them and try to
        incorporate the working some of those characteristics for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And for me, Bruce Lee is one such person. I'll try to explain how and
        why his life had impacted me on my professional carrier and more so
        with my personal life. More importantly, I'm going to convey this in
        my own style without formally reading his books or books written by
        others about him.
      </p>
      <p>
        We all know that Bruce Lee is not just an extraordinary martial artist
        but also a deep thinker. So, that much I know from watching videos
        about him and some resources and his quotations that I learned from
        the Internet. Hence, I'm going to give a brief of what my perspectives
        about him are.

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uk1lzkH-e4U" target="_blank">Bruce Lee Interview by Pierre Berton</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Bruce Lee's simple philosophy of living is his explanation of "Be
        Water" portrayed in his The "Lost" Interview in Pierre Berton show.
        There is a catch in that which is very important where he says "be
        formless and shapeless". It means that if you are too rigid on
        yourself; you cannot grow and mature in your life. It can be seen in
        his fighting style that were changed and adopted during different
        phases of his life and coming up with his own martial artform called
        Jeet Kune Do.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't end there; he also puts one more important point in that
        interview which is the yin-yang philosophy. He portrays that as - "You
        cannot be too natural or too unnatural, the ideal solution is natural
        unnaturalness or unnatural naturalness".
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what they say in Buddhism, walking the middle path or to put
        in other terms, the way of life is to change what you can, but never
        lose to go with the flow as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of those many thoughts of Bruce Lee that was said by his close
        knits and his students is he wants you to live by your own goals with
        your own principles and not just being a mere follower of somebody or
        himself, but expressing yourself honestly to others and to the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many players in this world, who inspire by talk. But the man
        in the arena guy for me is Bruce Lee. Because his very living in this
        world is an example that one can succeed with hard work, determination
        and deep focus.
